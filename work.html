													</header>
														<ul>
															<li style="text-align:left;">From my freshman through senior year of College, I assisted students 
																with their studies in programming, problem-solving, data structures and algorithms. I spent time grading assignments 
																and organized one on one tutoring sessions with students. I also actively participated in weekly meetings with the 
																Computer Science Faculty, collaborating on strategies to enhance the overall student learning experience.

												<h4 style="text-align:left;"><a >CodePath Tech Fellow</a></h4>

													<ul>
														<li style="text-align:left;">In my junior year, I had the privilege of being selected as a CodePath Tech Fellow, 
															an opportunity that allowed me to instruct a one-credit introductory Cybersecurity course for my peers. 
															This experience was both demanding and tremendously fulfilling. I worked closely with a student leader and a 
															faculty member to enhance the overall student learning experience. I provided technical guidance and feedback 
															to students as they tackled XSS, SQL injection, and Cryptography projects. Through through engagement activities 
															and regular reminders, I helped maintain a 100% assignment submission rate and ensured consistently 
															high attendance.</li>

													<h4 style="text-align:left;"><a >Software Engineer - Green Filing</a></h4>
													</header>
														<ul>
															<li style="text-align:left;">After graduating, I swiftly transitioned into an internship role where I was tasked with a challenge of
																integrating AWS cloud technologies with the company's existing application. Despite the initial estimate of over 3 months, 
																I managed to complete this project in just 1.5 months. During this time, I acquired and proficiently applied a comprehensive set 
																of technologies, including Java programming language and AWS tools like SES, S3, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch, Rest API, Java SDK, and CLI. 
																I was recognized for my contributions, and within a month into my employment, I received apromotion elevating me from an intern to a junior software developer.
																Currently, I am actively in the process of integrating my summer project into different sections of our codebase to enhance our 
																overall operational efficiency.</li>
