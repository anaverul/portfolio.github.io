													<h3><a >Detecting typographic, particle, and sentence formation errors<br />
														in JLPT N5 sentences using a rules-based system</a></h3>
													</header>
													<p>
													  While modern CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Systems offer a wide range of study resources, only a small portion of them offer
													  evaluation. This is because the evaluation process still heavily depends on the instructor and cannot be fully performed by a computer.
													  In order to improve Japanese CALL Systems, I explored the effectiveness of a rules-based system 
													  for detecting typographic, particle, and sentence formation errors in introductory level Japanese texts. You can view my 
													  research paper, poster, and Data Architecture Diagram <a href="https://portfolios.cs.earlham.edu/index.php/students/2023-2/cs488/ana-verulidze/" target="_blank">here</a>.

													<h3><a >Implementing the Restarting Weighted A* Algorithm
														</a></h3>
													</header>
													<p>
														Anytime search algorithms are often used to solve optimization problems where finding the first solution quickly is more important than finding the optimal solution. 
														The algorithms continue to improve the solution as they are given more time to run. 
														The algorithm I implemented in my study is the Restarting Weighted A* proposed by Silvia Richter et al. 
														In contrast to the Weighted A* algorithm that uses a fixed weight for all search iterations, the RWA* restarts the search 
														with a different weight after a certain number of expansions. This algorithm is designed to improve the performance of WA* 
														in changing environments, where the heuristic estimates may become inaccurate. By restarting the search with a lower weight parameter, 
														the algorithm can re-adjust its search strategy to adapt to the changing environment and find a new optimal path to the goal.

													<h3><a >Lights Out Puzzle Research Project
														</a></h3>
													</header>
													<p>
														Lights out puzzle is a strategy game that can be analyzed and solved as a linear algebra problem.
														In its simplest form, the puzzle features a grid of switches, where toggling a switch not only changes its own state,
														but also triggers the switching of adjacent horizontal and vertical switches. Given the lack of prior research in this field, 
														it offers lots of opportunities for exploration and room for uncertainty, which made it especially fascinating for me. As a start,
														I helped implement the Gaussian Elimination and the Euclidian Algorithm in Sagemath. I also co-designed and created software that not only calculates 
														the total number of solutions, but also provides accurate predictions for the initial puzzle solution. Subsequently, under the guidance of a faculty mentor, 
														I developed and published a user-friendly web interface for the game. This interactive website allows users to generate, draw, and solve puzzles of various types. 
														You can try it <a href="https://anaverul.github.io/lights-out-graph/interface.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

													<h3><a >Icelandic Field Studies Research Project
														</a></h3>
													</header>
													<p>
												     Icelandic field studies is a multidisciplinary research project generously funded by National Geographic bringing together 
													diverse fields of archaeology, biology, geology, 
													 environmental sustainability, computer science, history, culture and more. In my role as a member of the Drone Team, I collaborated with 
													 a group of twelve researchers to investigate the profound impacts of climate change in the Arctic Region — a region warming nearly four times faster than the global average. 
													 Thus, conducting our research in this location is beneficial for predicting risks our 
													 planet may face in years to come. Together with two other students, I undertook the task of capturing aerial imagery of the Sólheimajökull glacier, 
													 monitoring its fluctuations in elevation over time. I contributed to the development of a program that extracted essential data, including location, 
													 longitude, and altitude, from these images to construct precise 3D models of the glacier.  Our team was also entrusted with collecting Infrared imagery to 
													 identify native grass and measure the motion of invasive species. What sets our research apart is our reliance on 
													 inexpensive and easily accessible drone equipment and open software to analyze processes that are critical for the future of our planet.
